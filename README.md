# DebrisDice
Montecarlo model to propagate debris flow

This FORTRAN model performs random walk runs to model the debris flow propagation.

Has been coded and developed in UPC, Civil Engineering School

There is some documentation in (spanish) in the "doc" folder.

The computational mesh is a DEM (topo.dat) in ESRI ASCII format and the initiation points are defined in a second raster (observed_ini.dat) again in ESRI ASCII format.
